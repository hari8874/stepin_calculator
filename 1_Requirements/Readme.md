It is able to perform modulus between two numbers. 6. It is able to find power of two numbers. 7. It is able to find factorial of one number.

Research
Electronic calculators contain a keyboard with buttons for digits and arithmetical operations; some even contain "00" and "000" buttons to make larger or smaller numbers easier to enter. Most basic calculators assign only one digit or operation on each button; however, in more specific calculators, a button can pe… Display output Calculators usually have liquid-crystal displays (LCD) as output in place of historical light-emitting diode (LED) displays and vacuum fluorescent displays (VFD); details are provided in the section Technical improvements. Large-sized figures are often used to improve readability; while using decimal separator … Memory Calculators also have the ability to store numbers into computer memory. Basic calculators usually store only one number at a time; more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in variables. The variables can also be used for constructing formulas.

Cost and Features and Timeline
The best thing about the project is its free of cost.

SWOT ANALYSIS
Who:
All students in school or college level
What:
By using the calculator we can perform the basic calculations easily.
When:
The calculator came to usage many years ago .Previously there were other ways to do it.
Where:
Schools,colleges and engineering students.
How:
The usage of this project is very simple as it is an input output application. The user just needs to type in whatever he or she needs for example, if he or she needs to know the addition of two numbers,then the numbers and the symbol related to operation has to be given as input then output is shown
High Level Requirements:
1.arithmatic calculations

Low level Requirements:
1.addition  ----- depends upon the user to give number of inputs
2.substraction 
3.multiply
4.divide
5.finding the square of a number
6.finding the square root of a numer
